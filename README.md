# MultiPie

A Python library for crystallographic symmetry operations and Symmetry-Adapted Multipole Basis (SAMB).
Molecular or crystal structures are best drawn by using [QtDraw](https://github.com/CMT-MU/QtDraw).

## Installation

MultiPie can be installed from PyPI using pip on Python >= 3.8:
```
pip install multipie
```
You can also visit
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/multipie/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/CMT-MU/MultiPie) to download the source.
